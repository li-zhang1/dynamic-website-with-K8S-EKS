# Hosting a Dynamic Application with Kubernetes on AWS EKS

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following tools installed and configured:

- **AWS CLI**: Installed and configured
- **kubectl**: [Installation Guide](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl-macos/#install-with-homebrew-on-macos)
- **eksctl**: [Installation Guide](https://eksctl.io/installation/)
- **Helm**: [Installation Guide](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/)
- **Docker**: Installed
- **AWS IAM Permissions**: Permissions to manage EKS, ECR, Route 53, ACM, and Secrets Manager

---

## 1. Create a Dockerfile and Build Docker Image Locally

Create a `Dockerfile` in your project root directory. Then, build the Docker image using the following command:

```sh
docker build --platform linux/amd64 -t rentzone .
```

---

## 2. Push the Docker Image to Amazon ECR

### Build the Docker Image Locally

Run the following commands to make the build script executable and run it:

```sh
chmod +x build_image.sh
./build_image.sh
```

### Create an Amazon ECR Repository

Create a new ECR repository using AWS CLI:

```sh
aws ecr create-repository --repository-name rentzone --region us-east-1
```

### Retag Docker Image

Retag your Docker image with the repository URI:

```sh
docker tag <image-tag> <repository-uri>
```

### Login to Amazon ECR

Log in to your ECR registry using the following command:

```sh
aws ecr get-login-password | docker login --username AWS --password-stdin <aws_account_id>.dkr.ecr.<region>.amazonaws.com
```

### Push Docker Image to ECR Repository

Push your Docker image to the ECR repository:

```sh
docker push <repository-uri>
```

---

## 3. Create EKS Cluster and Node Group

Create an EKS cluster and worker nodes using AWS Management Console or `eksctl`. Refer to the official [eksctl documentation](https://eksctl.io/) for detailed steps.

---

## 4. Create Kubernetes YAML Files and deploy components to EKS

You can find the YAML files for Kubernetes deployment and detailed instructions on deploying to EKS [here](https://github.com/li-zhang1/eks-yaml-deployment-files-projects).

---

## 5. Configure Network Load Balancer and Target Groups

Once the service is deployed, create a Kubernetes service that exposes your application to the outside world. Apply the service YAML file:

```sh
SERVICE_FILE_NAME="service.yaml"
kubectl apply -f $SERVICE_FILE_NAME
```

---

## 6. Configure Route 53 for a Custom Domain

Create an **A Record** in **Route 53** to point to the Load Balancer DNS name associated with your service.

---

## 7. Request an SSL Certificate with ACM

Request an SSL certificate via **AWS ACM** for your custom domain. Follow the AWS [ACM Documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/acm/latest/userguide/acm-overview.html) for detailed steps.

---

## 8. Store Secrets in AWS Secrets Manager

Use **AWS Secrets Manager** to securely store and manage sensitive information, such as database credentials, API keys, etc.

## üîß Troubleshooting Guide

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Unauthorized Error When Creating a Namespace

**Issue:**
When running the following command:
```sh
kubectl create namespace your-namespace
```
and receiving an **unauthorized error**, ensure that the user attempting to access the cluster is the **same user** who created the EKS cluster.

**Solution:**
- Verify your AWS credentials using:
  ```sh
  aws sts get-caller-identity
  ```
- If you are using IAM roles, confirm that the correct IAM role has permissions to manage the cluster.
- Ensure your user is added to the `aws-auth` ConfigMap with the necessary permissions:
  ```sh
  kubectl get configmap aws-auth -n kube-system
  ```
  Update the ConfigMap if needed.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ CPU Architecture Mismatch Between Docker Image and EKS Worker Nodes

**Issue:**
The CPU architecture of your **Docker image** should match the architecture of your **EKS worker nodes**.
- **Windows OS** builds use: `linux/amd64`
- **Mac (M1/M2) OS** builds use: `linux/arm64`

If you build a Docker image on an M1/M2 Mac and your worker nodes are running `linux/amd64`, your pod will **fail to deploy**.

**Solution:**
To ensure compatibility, specify the correct platform when building your Docker image:
```sh
docker build --platform linux/amd64 -t your-image-name .
```

**Architecture Mapping:**
- `X86_64` ‚Üí Windows OS: `linux/amd64`
- `ARM64`  ‚Üí Mac OS (M1/M2): `linux/arm64`

To check the architecture of your worker nodes, run:
```sh
kubectl get nodes -o wide
```

---

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Pods Not Visible on EKS Worker Nodes

**Issue:**
After deploying pods to worker nodes, you check the node and **do not see the pod running** on the management console.

**Possible Cause:**
The pod might be **on the second page** of results. EKS paginates output when listing pods.

**Solution:**
- Use the following command to view all pods across all namespaces:
  ```sh
  kubectl get pods --all-namespaces
  ```
- If necessary, paginate through the list using:
  ```sh
  kubectl get pods --all-namespaces --limit=50
  ```
- Check pod status with:
  ```sh
  kubectl describe pod <pod-name>
  ```
  to diagnose potential scheduling issues.

By following these troubleshooting steps, you can resolve common issues when working with Amazon EKS. üöÄ

## Conclusion

Your dynamic application is now hosted on **AWS EKS**, complete with a custom domain, SSL encryption, and secret management. üéâ
